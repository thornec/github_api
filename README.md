Initial Plan for SWENG Project
<br/>
I want to see if I can build a website that takes a repo and find’s out who are the
10exer’s of this repo. I want to then shortlist this group of 10exers to who is the
10exer of the 10exers .ie the 1% of the 1%
Behind the scenes my measurement of a 10 exer are the programmers with;
1. Most Commits
2. Most Issues
3. Most Pull Requests
I will graph the top 10 of each of these fields into graphs
I will then try to find if there is anyone that is present in all of these fields
I will then try graph them
This general idea may change in the future depending on how possible it is to do
